# 2048 Implementation by thibclz (20caillierez)

### Run this master branch :

1) Open a terminal in ./build/
2) Type cmake.. to build the makefile and the cmake project (to debug)
3) To run the project type type "make" then "./2048"
4) To erase the build type "rm -rf *"

**NOTE** : the second branch (makefile_only) doesn't use CMake to build the project, simply type "make" then "./2048" and have a fun ! 

Coming soon (??) :
* graphic interface
* score system
